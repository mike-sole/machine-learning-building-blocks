    "# Vector Similarity Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector similarity measures are a key Machine Learning building block. In this context, a vector encodes properties (features) of an entity, known as a **feature vector**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A $\\vec{a}$ vector represents a point (coordinate) in space along with a magnitude (length) and direction. These properties are illustrated in the following interactive graph where:\n",
    "* $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are vectors\n",
    "  * $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ start at the origin and end at the arrow tip where the vector coordinate point can be found (the interactive chart allows the point to be dragged around)\n",
    "  * Vector magnitude (length) is shown by the intersecting labels\n",
    "* Angle between the directions of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$\n",
    "* Distance between $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ coordinates is shown by the dashed line\n",

    "* Distance between vector points (coordinates)\n",
    "  * Known as the **Euclidean distance** \n",
    "* Difference between vector directions\n",
    "  * Calculated using the cosine of the angle between two vectors. The cosine function returns the value of 1 when two vectors point in the same direction and -1 when two vectors point in the opposite direction. Therefore the cosine function maps both 0 - 180 degrees and 360 - 180 degrees to the range of 1 to -1. \n",
