    "The perceptron is a foundational learning algorithm and the elementary building block of neural networks. Grasping its function is crucial for understanding how modern deep learning models work, which achieve state-of-the-art performance in fields like natural language processing and computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties of the perceptron:\n",
    "* **Classifier**: It produces a categorical output, predicting a class label like 'spam' or 'not spam'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linear**: The model's decision boundary is a straight line, which means it can only separate data that is linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised**: It learns from a labeled dataset, where the correct output for each input is provided during training.\n",

    "The perceptron mdoel is a weighted sum followed by a threshold - a previous blog post introduced the [weighted sum](https://mike-sole.github.io/machine-learning-building-blocks/2024/04/06/weighted-sum.html). During training, the perceptron learns the weight vector part of the weighted sum. During inference\n",
    "\n",
    "A perceptron is represented by a vector. This vector is called a weight vector. \n",
    "* During training, weights are learnt to separate data into two classes \n",
    "* During inference, the weighted sum is calculated between the weight vector and an input vector followed by a threshold to assign a class label \n",

    "The weighted sum (dot product) between two vectors has the following properties:\n",
    "* positive if the angle between the vectors is < 90 degrees\n",
    "* 0 if the angle between the vectors is 90 degrees\n",
    "* negative if the angle between the vectors is > 90 degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the weighted sum (dot product) between two vectors is 0 when the angle between them is 90 degrees, geometrically a decision boundary perpendicular to the weight vector is defined. This decision boundary can be thought of as the threshold function, if an input vector has a weighted sum (dot product) value >= 0 then it is assigned one class label, otherwise it is assigned the other. The interactive graph below visualises this: \n",
    "* $\\vec{w}$ is the weight vector \n",
    "* red and blue points represent input vectors, each one has a label which shows the value of the weighted sum (dot product) with the weight vector\n",
    "* the dashed line is the decision boundary, input vector points are colored red or blue depending on which side of the decision boundary they lie\n",
    "* the weight vector can be dragged around which in turn moves the decision boundary \n",
