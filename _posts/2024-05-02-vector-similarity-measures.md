Vector similarity measures are a key Machine Learning building block. In this context, a vector encodes properties (features) of an entity, known as a **feature vector**. A previous blog post introduced the [weighted sum](https://mike-sole.github.io/machine-learning-building-blocks/2024/04/06/weighted-sum.html) which is often referred to as the Dot Product similarity measure.  

In this blog post, we will cover three vector similarity measures:
* Euclidean Distance
* Dot Product
* Cosine 

# Interpretation

Geometric interpretations of the three vector similarity measures will be presented in this section. 

Given feature vector A and B ...
