At the heart of machine learning, data science, signal processing and beyond lies the **weighted sum**.  

A normal sum: 
$$10 + 5 + 3 = 18$$

A weighted sum for $10 + 5 + 3$ given weights $(1, 4, 10)$:

$$(10 * 1) + (5 * 4) + (3 * 10) = 10 + 20 + 30 = 70$$

Before adding numbers together, each number is scaled with respect to its corresponding weight. As a result, weights control the overall contribution of each number.









## Code

Without a library:


```python

```

With the numpy library:


```python
import numpy as np

feature = np.array([1, 1])
weights = np.array([0.5, 0.5])

print(np.dot(feature, weights))
```

    1.0
    

also highlight multi case ... to then talk about matrix by vector after

## Maths

Linear algebra defines the weighted sum as the dot product (aka inner product) operation. The following notation is used to represent the dot product between $a$ and $b$

$$
  a \cdot b
$$
